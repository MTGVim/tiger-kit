# Shared UI Evidence

Read only references whose conditions below hold; return criteria and gaps to the caller,
which retains scope, approvals and completion. References invoke no workflow and grant no
installation, mutation, secret, Git or publication authority.

Resolve owners in the current installed skill collection (`dependencies.json`), not memory,
another installation, hardcoded homes or a source-checkout fallback. A missing/mismatched
owner or resource blocks the affected action: guide to `tk-setup-skills`, never silently install.
`<package>`, "package-local" and "this package" mean the caller's installed package unless a link names another owner.

## Conditional references

- [ui evidence](references/ui-evidence.md): collecting, verifying or reporting UI labels and entry paths.
